## Task 3 : SmartBank Enterprise System

Hey Y25s ! Hope you all did well in the OvertheWire assignment . Next Up : Working with real life applications of OOPS(Object Oriented Programming)

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a modular banking system where:

1.Customers can manage accounts
2.Transactions can be performed securely
3.Loans and ATM services can be handled
4.Banking operations are modeled using proper class relationship
##  Features

- **Multi-Level Hierarchy:** Manage multiple branches under a single Bank entity.
- **Diverse Account Types:** Supports Savings, Current, and Fixed Deposit accounts with specific business logic (interest rates, overdrafts, maturity).
- **Transaction Engine:** Securely handle deposits, withdrawals, and transfers between accounts with history tracking.
- **Loan Management:** Process various loan types (Home, Car, Personal) with EMI calculations.
- **ATM Services:** Integrated ATM card management with status tracking and PIN security.
- **Notification System:** Polymorphic notification implementation supporting both SMS and Email alerts.

##  System Architecture (UML)

The system is designed with a strong focus on class relationships:

- **Inheritance:** `Account` is an abstract base class for `SavingsAccount`, `CurrentAccount`, and `FixedDepositAccount`.
- **Interfaces:** `Notification` is implemented by `SMSNotification` and `EmailNotification`.
- **Associations:** 
    - A `Customer` can own multiple `Accounts`.
    - A `Branch` manages multiple `Employees` and `Accounts`.
    - `Transactions` link a sender and a receiver `Account`.

##  Class Structure

### Core Entities

| :--- | :--- |
| **Bank** | Root entity managing branches, customers, and overall organization. |
| **Branch** | Local office handling specific accounts and staff. |
| **Customer** | Stores personal details and linked financial products. |
| **Employee** | Represents staff members with specific designations (Manager, Cashier). |

### Financial Products

- **Current Account:** Supports overdraft limits and business-specific charges.
- **Fixed Deposit:** Tracks tenure, interest rates, and maturity amounts.
- **Loan:** Manages principal, interest, and EMI status.
